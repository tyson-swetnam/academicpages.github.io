My first career was in a wildland firefighting for the US DOI National Park Service, and later as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service.

My graduate education in [natural resource management](https://snre.arizona.edu/) and dendrochronology [<sup>1</sup>](https://ltrr.arizona.edu/)<sup>,</sup>[<sup>2</sup>](http://rmtrr.org/), came with a strong emphasis on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing which became the focus of my current work.

Today, I am a [*geoinformatician*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoinformatics) working with spatial data infrastructure for [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org).
