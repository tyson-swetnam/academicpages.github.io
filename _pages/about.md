My first career was in wildland firefighting, working for the US DOI National Park Service. Later, I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service.

My graduate education in [natural resources management](https://snre.arizona.edu/), dendrochronology and dendroecology [<sup>1</sup>](https://ltrr.arizona.edu/)<sup>,</sup>[<sup>2</sup>](http://rmtrr.org/), had a strong emphasis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing of large data sets. These broader topics in data science eventually became the dominant foci of my current research.

Today, I am an Research Assistant Professor of [*Geoinformatics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoinformatics) at the University of Arizona [BIO5 Institute](http://www.bio5.org/). I work on spatial data cyberinfrastructure for [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org), collaborating with a diverse group of data science oriented projects in the life and earth sciences.

My research interests include applied use of cyberinfrastructure for geospatial analysis, data science best practices (for reproducible research), as well as metadata and ontology (information science).
