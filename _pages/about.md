I spent the early parts of my career as a wildland firefighter and fire management specialist for the US DOI National Park Service, and USDA Forest Service in Southeastern Arizona. My graduate education was in natural resource management with a heavy focus on GIS and remote sensing. 

My current work concerns large scale spatial data analysis and spatial data infrastructure for research computing in the life sciences as part of a NSF funded cyberinfrastructure project called [Cyverse](http://www.cyverse.org).
