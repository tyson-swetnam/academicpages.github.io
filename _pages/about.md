My first career was in wildland firefighting, working for the US DOI National Park Service. Later I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service.

My graduate education in [natural resources management](https://snre.arizona.edu/), dendrochronology and dendroecology [<sup>1</sup>](https://ltrr.arizona.edu/)<sup>,</sup>[<sup>2</sup>](http://rmtrr.org/), had a strong emphasis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing of large data sets. These broader topics in data science eventually became the dominant foci of my current research.

Today, I am an Assistant Research Professor of [*Geoinformatics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoinformatics) at the University of Arizona [BIO5 Institute](http://www.bio5.org/). I work on spatial data cyberinfrastructure for [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org), collaborating with a diverse group of data science oriented projects in life and earth sciences.

I am interested in applied research which requires the use of cyberinfrasctructure for geospatial data analyses, data science best practices for reproducible research, metadata and ontology (information science).
