A data-driven personal website

My education was in ecology and watershed management, with a heavy focus on remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS).

I have worked for the DOI National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, as a private contractor doing dendroecology research, and as an academic researcher in natural resources and geosciences.

My current work concerns large scale spatial data analysis and spatial data infrastructure for research computing in the life sciences as part of a NSF funded cyberinfrastructure project.
