I am a Research Assistant Professor of [*Geoinformatics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoinformatics) at the University of Arizona [BIO5 Institute](http://www.bio5.org/). I work on spatial data cyberinfrastructure for [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org), collaborating with a diverse group of data science oriented projects in the life and earth sciences.

My research interests include applied use of cyberinfrastructure for geospatial analysis, data science best practices (for reproducible research), as well as metadata and ontology (information science).

I teach workshops to other researchers on as part of the [CyVerse Learning Institute](https://learning.cyverse.org/en/latest/), and am an active member of the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [Research Bazaar Arizona](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/)

### A bit about me:

My first career was in wildland firefighting, working for the US DOI National Park Service. Later, I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service.

My Master's and Ph.D. were in [natural resources management](https://snre.arizona.edu/), dendrochronology and dendroecology [<sup>1</sup>](https://ltrr.arizona.edu/)<sup>,</sup>[<sup>2</sup>](http://rmtrr.org/). My earlier research had a strong emphasis on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing of large data sets. Those experiences helped lead me to my current position in data science and informatics.
