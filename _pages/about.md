My formal education was in landscape ecology and watershed management with a focus on remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS).

I have worked for the DOI National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, as a private contractor doing dendroecology research, and as an academic researcher in natural resources and geosciences, before moving into the data sciences.

My current work concerns large scale spatial data analysis and spatial data infrastructure for research computing in the life sciences as part of a NSF funded cyberinfrastructure project.
