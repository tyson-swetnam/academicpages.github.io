My first career was as a wildland firefighter and fire management specialist for the US DOI National Park Service and USDA Forest Service.

My education in natural resource management and dendrochronology came with a strong emphasis on Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing which became the focus of my current work.

Today, I work mostly on spatial data infrastructures as a data scientist for [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org).
